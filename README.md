# schematch

Schema-first pattern matching for TypeScript.

`schematch` lets you use [Standard Schema](https://standardschema.dev) validators (zod, valibot, arktype et. al.) as matcher clauses, so validation and branching share one source of truth.

## Install

```sh
pnpm add schematch
```

## Quick start

```typescript
import {match} from 'schematch'
import {z} from 'zod'

const output = match(input)
  .case(z.string(), s => `hello ${s.slice(1, 3)}`)
  .case(z.array(z.number()), arr => `got ${arr.length} numbers`)
  .case(z.object({msg: z.string()}), obj => obj.msg)
  .otherwise(() => 'unexpected')
```

This works with zod, valibot, arktype, and any other standard-schema compatible library. You can even mix and match libraries:

```typescript
import {match} from 'schematch'
import {z} from 'zod'
import * as v from 'valibot'
import {type} from 'arktype'

const output = match(input)
  .case(z.string(), s => `hello ${s.slice(1, 3)}`)
  .case(v.array(v.number()), arr => `got ${arr.length} numbers`)
  .case(type({msg: 'string'}), obj => obj.msg)
  .otherwise(() => 'unexpected')
```

## Reusable matcher builders

You can prebuild a matcher once into a function, and reuse it across many inputs:

```typescript
import {match} from 'schematch'
import {z} from 'zod'

const myMatcher = match
  .case(z.string(), s => `hello ${s.slice(1, 3)}`)
  .case(z.array(z.number()), arr => `got ${arr.length} numbers`)
  .case(z.object({msg: z.string()}), obj => obj.msg)
  .otherwise(() => 'unexpected')

myMatcher('hello')
myMatcher([1, 2, 3])
myMatcher({msg: 'yo'})
```

This avoids rebuilding the fluent chain for hot paths.

You can constrain reusable matcher input types up front:

```typescript
type Result = {type: 'ok'; value: number} | {type: 'err'; message: string}

const TypedMatcher = match
  .input<Result>()
  .case(z.object({type: z.literal('ok'), value: z.number()}), ({value}) => value)
  .otherwise(() => -1)
```

Similarly, you can constrain the output type with `.output<T>()`:

```typescript
const TypedMatcher = match
  .input<Result>()
  .output<number>()
  .case(z.object({type: z.literal('ok'), value: z.number()}), ({value}) => value)
  .otherwise(() => -1)
```

This also works on inline matchers:

```typescript
const output = match(input)
  .output<string | number>()
  .case(z.number(), n => n + 1)
  .otherwise(() => 'fallback')
```

## Why use this

- 🔁 Reuse existing runtime schemas for control flow.
- 🧩 Mix schema libraries in one matcher (via Standard Schema).
- 🔍 Keep type inference for handler inputs and return unions.
- 🪓 Avoid duplicating validation logic in `if`/`switch` trees.

## Performance

`schematch` includes compiled matcher caching and library-specific fast paths (literals, object/tuple/union/discriminator prechecks). Reusable matchers avoid rebuilding the fluent chain entirely, giving an additional speedup on hot paths.

**vs arktype native `match`:**

Arktype has its own [`match` API](https://arktype.io/docs/match) that uses set theory to skip unmatched branches. For primitive type discrimination, it's the fastest option. For nested object schemas, `schematch` is faster because it uses arktype's `.allows()` for zero-allocation boolean checks.

*Primitive type discrimination* (`string | number | boolean | null`, `bigint`, `object`):

**Discriminator dispatch** (15 branches, reusable matcher with dispatch table):

This benchmark uses 15 object schemas with a shared `kind` discriminator key and 2-4 additional typed fields each — a realistic event-sourcing or webhook scenario. It shows how the dispatch table helps as the branch count grows, especially for late-matching inputs.

<!-- bench:fullName="tests/bench/discriminator-dispatch.bench.ts > 15-branch discriminated: mixed inputs (realistic)" -->

| Matcher | ops/sec | vs fastest |
|---|---|---|
| schematch arktype (reusable + dispatch) | 2,940,143 | fastest |
| schematch valibot (reusable + dispatch) | 2,485,785 | 1.18x slower |
| schematch zod (reusable + dispatch) | 2,420,443 | 1.21x slower |
| schematch zod (inline) | 808,357 | 3.64x slower |
| ts-pattern | 358,838 | 8.19x slower |

The dispatch advantage grows with branch position. For the last branch (worst case for sequential scan):

## How it works

Calling `match(value).case(schema, handler)` or building a reusable matcher looks simple, but under the hood schematch compiles each schema into a specialised matcher the first time it's seen, caches it, and then applies a layered series of fast paths before ever falling back to the schema library's own `validate` call. The layers are described below, roughly in the order they're tried.

### Compiled matcher caching

Every schema object is compiled into a `{ sync, async }` pair of functions exactly once. The compiled matcher is stored directly on the schema object via a well-known symbol (`Symbol.for('schematch.compiled-matcher')`). If the object is frozen or non-extensible, a `WeakMap` fallback is used instead. Subsequent calls with the same schema instance hit one of these caches and skip compilation entirely.

**Tradeoff:** Caching on the schema object itself is the fastest lookup (property access), but mutates the schema. The WeakMap fallback avoids that at the cost of a hash lookup. Both are per-instance, so structurally identical but distinct schema objects compile independently.

### Literal fast path

Before trying any library-specific path, the compiler checks whether the schema represents a single literal value (e.g. `z.literal('ok')`, `v.literal(42)`, `type('ok')`). If so, the compiled matcher is a single `Object.is()` comparison — zero allocation, no validation overhead.

Detection is duck-typed across libraries: arktype's `unit` property, valibot's `type === 'literal'` with a `.literal` field, and zod's `_def.type === 'literal'` with a single-element `values` array.

**Tradeoff:** Relies on internal schema structure rather than a public API. This is fragile across library major versions but turns what would be a full validation call into a single comparison.

### Library-specific compiled matchers

When the literal fast path doesn't apply, the compiler detects which library produced the schema by looking for internal properties (`_zod`, `~run`, `.allows`) and generates a tailored matcher:

**Zod** (`_zod.run`): Calls zod's internal `run` method directly instead of going through `~standard.validate`. Pre-allocates payload (`{value, issues}`) and context (`{async: false}`) objects and reuses them across calls by mutating `.value` and setting `.issues.length = 0`. This avoids allocating new objects on every match attempt.

**Valibot** (`~run`): Similar approach — calls valibot's internal `~run` directly. Pre-allocates a shared `config` object.

**Arktype** (`.allows`): Uses arktype's `.allows(value)` method, which returns a boolean without creating result objects or issue arrays — zero allocation per call. When the schema has no transforms, the input value is returned directly without calling the full validation pipeline.

**Generic fallback**: For any other Standard Schema V1 implementation, calls `~standard.validate` and inspects the result.

**Tradeoff:** Duck-typing library internals provides significant speedups (the zod/valibot paths avoid result object allocation; the arktype path avoids validation entirely for non-transform schemas) but couples schematch to implementation details. A new major version of any library could break detection. The generic fallback ensures correctness regardless.

### Recursive prechecks

For zod and valibot, the compiler recursively walks the schema definition tree and builds a lightweight boolean predicate — a "precheck" — that can reject non-matching values cheaply before invoking the library's validation.

The precheck handles: literals (`Object.is`), primitives (`typeof`), objects (per-key checks), tuples (per-item checks with length bounds), unions (any-of), discriminated unions/variants (Map lookup on discriminator key), `null`/`undefined`/`Date`/`instanceof`.

Each precheck node is classified as **complete** or **partial**:

- **Complete**: The precheck fully covers the schema's type constraint (no transforms, refinements, `.pipe()`, `.checks`, or unhandled schema types in the tree). When a precheck is complete, the library's validation is skipped entirely — the precheck result alone determines match/no-match, and the raw input value is returned.
- **Partial**: The precheck can fast-reject values that definitely don't match (e.g. wrong `typeof`, missing discriminator) but a passing precheck still requires full validation to confirm. This is the common case for schemas with `.min()`, `.regex()`, `.refine()`, etc.

For valibot's `variant` type (discriminated union), the precheck builds a `Map<discriminatorValue, check>` for O(1) dispatch on the discriminator field, rather than iterating through union options.

**Tradeoff:** Complete prechecks give the biggest speedup (full validation bypass) but return the input value as-is, so they cannot be used with schemas that apply transforms. Partial prechecks still help by avoiding expensive validation calls for obvious mismatches, at the cost of the precheck function call overhead on values that do match. The recursive walk happens once at compile time, not per match.

### Reusable matchers

When you write `match.case(...).case(...).otherwise(...)` (without an input value), schematch builds a `ReusableMatcher` that stores the clause list as a plain array at construction time. The returned function iterates the pre-built array on each call — no `new MatchExpression()`, no fluent chain, no per-call allocation of clause structures. Benchmarks show a ~20-40% throughput increase over inline matching.

**Tradeoff:** The reusable matcher's clause array is allocated once and shared across calls. This is faster but means the matcher is fixed after construction — you can't add branches dynamically.

### Cross-branch discriminator dispatch

When a reusable matcher's `.case()` branches are all object schemas sharing a common literal-typed key (e.g. `type`, `kind`, `status`), schematch automatically builds a dispatch table at construction time. On each match attempt, instead of trying every branch sequentially, it reads the discriminator value from the input and jumps directly to the candidate branch(es).

Discriminator extraction is library-specific:

- **Zod/zod-mini**: Inspects `_def.shape` for keys whose sub-def has `type === 'literal'` with a single value.
- **Valibot**: Inspects `schema.entries` for keys where `entry.type === 'literal'`.
- **Arktype**: Inspects `schema.json.required` for entries where `value.unit` exists.

When multiple keys are literal-typed, preferred discriminator names (`type`, `kind`, `status`, `_tag`, `tag`) take priority. Clauses without an extractable discriminator (e.g. `.when()` predicates, non-object schemas) go into a fallback set that's always checked. Original clause ordering is preserved — first-match-wins semantics are maintained.

**Tradeoff:** Only applies to reusable matchers (not inline), only works for object schemas with shared literal keys, and adds a small construction-time cost for schema introspection. For non-discriminated schemas or non-object inputs, the dispatch table is skipped and matching falls back to the linear scan.

### Enhanced exhaustive errors

When `.exhaustive()` throws because no branch matched, the error message now includes:

- **Discriminator info** (reusable matchers): If a dispatch table exists, the error reports the discriminator key, the actual value, and the expected values. For example: `Discriminator 'type' has value "unknown" but expected one of: "ok", "err"`.
- **Per-schema validation issues**: The error re-validates the input against each candidate schema (or all schemas if no dispatch table exists) and formats the issues. For example: `Case 1: ✖ Expected number → at value`.

Re-validation only happens on the error path, so there is no performance impact on successful matches. The `NonExhaustiveError` object also exposes `.schemas` and `.discriminator` properties for programmatic access.

### Micro-optimisations

A few smaller techniques contribute to throughput:

- **Sentinel symbols** (`NO_MATCH`, `ASYNC_REQUIRED`): Using symbols as return values avoids wrapping match results in `{matched: false}` objects. Control flow is a simple reference equality check.
- **Early short-circuit**: Once a branch matches, all subsequent `.case()` calls are no-ops (`if (this.matched) return this`).
- **Singleton unmatched state**: A single frozen `{matched: false, value: undefined}` object is shared across all unmatched branches.
- **Indexed for-loops**: All inner loops use `for (let i = 0; i < n; i += 1)` rather than `for...of` or `.forEach()`, avoiding iterator protocol overhead.
- **2-argument fast path**: The common `.case(schema, handler)` call skips guard detection, argument slicing, and inner-loop setup.

## API

### `match(value)`

Sync matcher builder:

- `.output<T>()` — constrain the return type of the matcher
- `.case(schema, handler)` — try a schema, run handler if it matches
- `.case(schema, predicate, handler)` — schema + guard
- `.case(schemaA, schemaB, ..., handler)` — multiple schemas, first match wins
- `.when(predicate, handler)` — no schema, just a predicate
- `.otherwise(handler)` — fallback
- `.exhaustive()` — throw if nothing matched
- `.run()` — execute without a fallback (returns `undefined` on no match)

`handler` receives `(parsedValue, input)` where `parsedValue` is schema output.

`match` also has static builder entrypoints:

- `match.input<T>()` — constrain the input type for a reusable matcher
- `match.output<T>()` — constrain the output type for a reusable matcher
- `match.case(...).case(...).otherwise(...)`
- `match.case(...).case(...).exhaustive(...)`

These return reusable functions that accept the input later.

### `matchAsync(value)`

Async equivalent for async schemas, guards, and handlers.

`matchAsync.case(...).case(...).otherwise(...)` and `.exhaustive(...)` are also available for reusable async matchers.

### `isMatching(schema, value?)` / `isMatchingAsync(schema, value?)`

Schema-backed type guards.

### `NonExhaustiveError`

Thrown by `.exhaustive()` when no branch matches.

## Type inference

- Handler input type is inferred from schema output type.
- Return types are unioned across branches.
- `isMatching` narrows from `unknown` using schema output.

## Comparison

### vs `ts-pattern`

- `ts-pattern` matches JS patterns directly and is excellent for structural matching.
- `schematch` matches with runtime schemas you already own.

Use `schematch` when schema-driven validation is central and you want matching to follow it.

### vs ad-hoc validation + branching

- Ad-hoc approach repeats parse checks and manual narrowing.
- `schematch` centralizes this in a single typed expression.

## Caveats

- Use `matchAsync`/`isMatchingAsync` for async schema validation.
- `.exhaustive()` is runtime exhaustive, not compile-time algebraic exhaustiveness.

## Exports

- `match`, `matchAsync`
- `isMatching`, `isMatchingAsync`
- `NonExhaustiveError`
- `StandardSchemaV1` and helper types: `InferInput`, `InferOutput`
